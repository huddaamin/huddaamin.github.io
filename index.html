	<p>A hardworking, reliable and enthusiastic young professional driven by passion and challenge. With over 3 years of experience in various customer service positions, I have a proven ability to communicate and problem solve effectively in addition to a strong set of interpersonal skills and flexibility.

	<P>When it comes to my education, I have studied accounting at the post-secondary level because of my ability to work well with numbers. Nonetheless, my passion has always been rooted in technology, specifically computers and mobile devices. 
	This passion has motivated me to change career paths and I now have my sights set on obtaining various professional certifications in IT.</P>

		“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.”
